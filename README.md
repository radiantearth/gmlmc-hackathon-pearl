Created by Development Seed + Micosoft

## Hackathon Goals

#### Create [STAC catalog](https://github.com/RadiantMLHub/ml4eo-bootcamp-2021/blob/main/Lecture%205/exercises/2_create_stac_label_item.ipynb) for subset of training data

* A [STAC catalog does exist for the cheseapke bay landcover labels + imagery](https://registry.mlhub.earth/10.1109/CVPR.2019.01301/), but PEARL aggregates classes in a slightly different way.

#### Create GMLMC for PEARL Model
